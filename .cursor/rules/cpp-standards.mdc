 Use modern c++20 constructs when writing code
 Follow the cpp core guidelines
 Use braced initialization over copy initialization or parentheses
 Follow good OOP design principles
 Make the code self-documenting through proper naming of variables - do not include inline comments in implementations ever
 Always use the scripts in this repo for configuring building. ./build.sh and ./configure.sh. If you need to extend them for testing something, suggest changes instead of using raw build commands.
 When working on a feature and checking if the feature compiles, build the smallest target possible - avoid building all until we have validated that the feature compiles and works as expected.
